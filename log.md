# 100 Days Of Code - Log Dimitri Ivashchuk

### Day 1: August 04, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my portfolio project that uses React as front-end and Firebase as a back-end.

**Thoughts:** Being able to do some server-side tasks without even starting a server and having scarce knowledge of back is quite enjoyable experience!

### Day 2: August 05, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Explored Firebase even further, it seems like a quite powerful thing. Worked on the UI of the portfolio app using styled-components, this library is so cool and powerful and I have many things to explore still.

**Thoughts:** Would be great if I had a mentor that knows everything about front-end so that I am not spending much time on just googling and trying to make things work.

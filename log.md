# 100 Days Of Code - Log Dimitri Ivashchuk

### Day 1: August 04, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my portfolio project that uses React as front-end and Firebase as a back-end.

**Thoughts:** Being able to do some server-side tasks without even starting a server and having scarce knowledge of back is quite enjoyable experience!

### Day 2: August 05, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Explored Firebase even further, it seems like a quite powerful thing. Worked on the UI of the portfolio app using styled-components, this library is so cool and powerful and I have many things to explore still.

**Thoughts:** Would be great if I had a mentor that knows everything about front-end so that I am not spending much time on just googling and trying to make things work.

### Day 3: August 05, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked with styles of the app little bit, achieved desired back-end functionality for now, tomorrow there will be a lot of work with react-router.

**Thoughts:** I really like how the community responds to questions and offers help when it is needed. Don't know for now, why everyone is accusing stack overflow of being toxic and impolite. Today I got stuck with couple of moments and help came in minutes if not in seconds.
I will probably publish the app I am working on within next couple of days, it is not in any case ready, but it has some functionality.

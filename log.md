# 100 Days Of Code - Log Dimitri Ivashchuk

### Day 1: August 04, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my portfolio project that uses React as front-end and Firebase as a back-end.

**Thoughts:** Being able to do some server-side tasks without even starting a server and having scarce knowledge of back is quite enjoyable experience!
